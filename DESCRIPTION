Title: Retain Resolve Microbiome Agglomeration
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sarah Asbury
Maintainer: The package maintainer <asburys@mcmaster.ca>
Description: This package has been developed to conveniently executes the retain-resolve agglomeration algorithm described in the manuscript: Mapping microbiota to clinical anxiety (Chin Fatt et al, 2022). The retain resolve algorithm requires ASV-level 16S count data stored as a phyloseq object. Users input parameters for the agglomeration and filtering thresholds. The main output is a phyloseq object containing a mix of retained ASV-level and resolved genus-level taxa and their counts.
